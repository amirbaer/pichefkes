## Task 001: Create core library structure with simple sourcing
**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Completed

### What was accomplished
- Created `bashargparse.sh` as the main library file
- Implemented simple single-command sourcing: `source bashargparse.sh`
- Set up internal state variables for storing argument definitions:
  - Parser metadata (`_ARGPARSE_PROG`, `_ARGPARSE_DESCRIPTION`)
  - Parallel arrays for argument properties (short, long, positional, help, default, required, type, choices, action, nargs, dest)
  - Positional arguments order tracking
- Added multiple-sourcing prevention
- Added version constant (`BASHARGPARSE_VERSION`)
- Included helper functions: `_argparse_to_varname()` and `_argparse_reset()`

### Files created/modified
- **Created:** `bashargparse.sh` - Main library file (71 lines)

### Testing performed
- Verified library sources without errors
- Verified internal state arrays are properly initialized
- Verified multiple-sourcing prevention works

### Issues encountered
- None
